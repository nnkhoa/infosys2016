1. Add the new departments
	INSERT INTO departments VALUES ('d010','Research and Development');
	Output:
		Query OK, 1 row affected (0,00 sec)
	INSERT INTO departments VALUES ('d011','Marketing and Sale');
	Output:
		Query OK, 1 row affected (0,00 sec)
Explaination: 	Add these 2 new rows first so that the other tables that are using 
				attributes in this table as their foreign keys will have something
				to reference.

2. Update tables with these new values
	- update dept_emp table
		UPDATE IGNORE dept_emp SET dept_no = 'd010' 
		WHERE dept_no = 'd005' OR dept_no = 'd008';
		Output:
			Query OK, 101599 rows affected, 5234 warnings (7,26 sec)
			Rows matched: 106833  Changed: 101599  Warnings: 5234

		DELETE FROM dept_emp WHERE dept_no = 'd008';
		Output:
			Query OK, 5234 rows affected (0,08 sec)

		UPDATE dept_emp SET dept_no = 'd011' 
		WHERE dept_no = 'd001' OR dept_no = 'd007';
		Output:
			Query OK, 68804 rows affected, 3652 warnings (2,97 sec)
			Rows matched: 72456  Changed: 68804  Warnings: 3652
		
		DELETE FROM dept_emp WHERE dept_no = 'd007';
		Output:
			Query OK, 3652 rows affected (0,08 sec)

		Explaination: 	UPDATE IGNORE will update rows that meet the condition (here, rows that have old department number)
						if there are duplicate rows, the duplicated rows are ignored (unchange) 
						then, delete rows that still have old department numbers	
	- update dept_manager table
		UPDATE dept_manager SET dept_no = 'd010' 
		WHERE dept_no = 'd005' OR dept_no = 'd008';	
		Output:
			Query OK, 4 rows affected (0,01 sec)
			Rows matched: 4  Changed: 4  Warnings: 0

		UPDATE dept_manager SET dept_no = 'd011' 
		WHERE dept_no = 'd001' OR dept_no = 'd007';
		Output:
			Query OK, 4 rows affected (0,00 sec)
			Rows matched: 4  Changed: 4  Warnings: 0

		Explaination:	Change the manager department numbers, since there was no manager that holds 2 departments
						the UPDATE IGNORE is not needed	

3. delete the old values from the departments table
	DELETE FROM departments WHERE dept_no = 'd001' OR dept_no = 'd005' OR dept_no = 'd007' OR dept_no = 'd008';
	Output:
		Query OK, 4 rows affected (0,01 sec)

	Explaination: 	wipe the rows that has no entry
